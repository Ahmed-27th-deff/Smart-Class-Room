# ðŸ“š Smart Classroom Attendance & Participation System

An AI-powered smart classroom solution that automatically detects students, recognizes faces, tracks their presence, and monitors hand-raising behavior in real-time using computer vision and deep learning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project automates classroom monitoring by analyzing video footage to:
- Detect student faces for **attendance tracking**
- Track individuals across frames
- Recognize **raised hands** using pose estimation
- Generate a CSV report summarizing participation and attendance
